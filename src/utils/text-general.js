        review: "Tom is really a great teacher. His lessons are very structural and coherent. He has special skills to explain grammatical complexities in an accessible and clear way. As a former teacher of French, I can appreciate his method and motivating approach to teaching. Besides, lessons with Tom are fun and they give me a lot of pleasure, especially when I can admire my own progress in Dutch ",
